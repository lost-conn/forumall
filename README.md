# Forumall

Forumall is an [OFSCP](https://github.com/lost-conn/ofscp "OFSCP") provider with an embedded web client. It is also the first OFSCP client or provider in development :)

Designed *for 'em all*, the goal is to have a provider that's easily deployable, so anyone can host their own.

## Status

Still a very-early work-in-progress. You can almost actually chat on it.
